This document site presents a hypothetical and under-specified vision for a potential future Zcash architecture written by me, Nate Wilcox ([`@nate_zec` ðŸ¡•](https://twitter.com/nate_zec)).

The ideas here are "unofficial" and there are currently no plans at [Electric Coin Co ðŸ¡•](https://electriccoin.co/blog/) or among the Zcash development community to pursue these ideas. I intend to refine and share these ideas across the Zcash community to see how feasible and beneficial this kind of architecture could be, but I don't promise any timeline or outcome.

The ideas in this document were stimulated from a variety of discussions with **[FIXME: acknowledge ppl here]**, although I take full responsibility for their presentation here and do not claim any of those great conversation partners endorse any particular idea here.

I will update this section if any of the above changes.
