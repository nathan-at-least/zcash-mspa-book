As of 2022-09-22,

This document site presents a hypothetical and under-specified vision for a potential future Zcash architecture written by me, Nate Wilcox ([Twitter `@nate_zec` ðŸ¡•](https://twitter.com/nate_zec), [GitHub `@nathan-at-least` ðŸ¡•](https://github.com/nathan-at-least)).

The ideas here are "unofficial" and there are currently no plans at [Electric Coin Co ðŸ¡•](https://electriccoin.co/blog/) or among the Zcash development community to pursue these ideas. I intend to refine and share these ideas across the Zcash community to see how feasible and beneficial this kind of architecture could be, but I don't promise any timeline or outcome.

## Acknowledgements

The ideas in this document were stimulated from a variety of discussions with Zooko, Sean Bowe, Steven Smith, Vitalik Buterin, David Campbell, and too many others to name. I take full responsibility for their presentation here and do not claim any of those great conversation partners endorse any particular idea here.

## Updates

I will update this document site as I continue to have discussions and develop the ideas, and reserve the possibility to substantially change the contents. I will update this section if any of the above changes, including if I find that the central tenants of these ideas are infeasible.
