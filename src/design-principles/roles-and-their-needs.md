# Roles and Their Needs

Stepping back to review the needs of a safe payments system, consider which participants need to know what information:

| Role | Need |
| ---- | ---- |
| Holder | To see their balance and the history that lead to it. |
| Spender | To know a recipient did or did not receive a transfer in a timely fashion. |
| Recipient | To know they've received a transfer, how much, any message from the sender associated with the payment, and that the payment is legitimately reliable. |
| Spenders and Receipients | To know their activity has strong privacy so that only parties they intend to disclose information to are privy to it. |
| All Participants | To know every transfer conserves the scarcity of `ZEC`, ie there are no double-spends or counterfeiting exploits. |
| All Infrastructure Providers | To know that their contribution is economically sustainable over long enough time periods. |
