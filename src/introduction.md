# Introduction

The Zcash Modular Scalable Payments Architecture (MSPA) is a theoretical new blockchain architecture specialized for Zcash shielded payments and storage.

The intent behind the name:

- _Modular_: Different required functionality is provided by distinct types of infrastructure for consensus, double-spend prevention, data availability, and network privacy.
- _Scalable_: The goal of the architecture is to support a high level of usage for relatively low typical transaction fees.
- _Payments_: The architecture is specialized to shielded Zcash payments.

The ideas described in this document are not currently part of the Zcash roadmap in any capacity I'm aware of, see [Status](./introduction/status.md).
