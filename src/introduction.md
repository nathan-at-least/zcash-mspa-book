# Introduction

The Zcash Modular Scalable Payments Architecture (MSPA) is a theoretical new blockchain architecture specialized for Zcash shielded payments and storage. The intent behind the name:

- _Modular_: Different required functionality is provided by distinct types of infrastructure for consensus, double-spend prevention, data availability, and network privacy.
- _Scalable_: The goal of the architecture is to support a high level of usage. A target metric for the scalability goal is for typical transaction fees to remain low while maintaining usability guarantees of safety, alacrity, and availability.
- _Payments_: The architecture is specialized to payments. This makes it distinct from blockchain architectures aimed at scaling stateful smart contracts.
